Good work all around!
Nice conversion to a 2-D array.

One issue: You correctly identify when the game is over, but you don't announce
whether there is a winner or whether it is a tie.  There are a couple of ways you could 
go about identifying the winner; consider what your options are!

Overall, very clean code.  Well done.
